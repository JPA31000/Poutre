# Poutre

This project is a simple web tool for sizing a reinforced concrete beam. The interface is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the p5.js library for the interactive graphics.

## Running the application

1. Make sure you have a modern web browser with an internet connection. The page loads p5.js from a CDN.
2. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser to start the application.

The calculator lets you define loading and section parameters and shows internal forces, diagrams and other results.
